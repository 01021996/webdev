//VARIABLES- js doesnt care about type of the variables
//JS is a dynamically typed language(data type is not specified)
// LET ,VAR , CONST
//var allows us to redeclaration
var a;
console.log(a)  //variable will be initialized with null

a=10;
console.log(a)

//DATA TYPES IN JS- NUMBERS,STRING,BOOLEAN,UNDEFINED ,NULL
//let doent allow redeclaration but reassigning is allowed 
// 2nd problem is scoping-outside functions it should not be used

// let a=20;
// let a=30;
// console.log(a)
//let is block level ,that is we cannot use it outside functions


//const doesnt allow redeclaration and also does not allow reassigning
const d=10;
// a=34;
console.log(d);
